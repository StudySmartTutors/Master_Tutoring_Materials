You are organizing books in your classroom library. Here’s what you have:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are \(48\) books, and you divide them equally among \(6\) shelves.
    \item You add \(5\) extra books to one of the shelves.
    \item There are \(2\) empty bins that can hold up to \(10\) books each.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=6em]
    \item How many books are on each shelf before adding extra books?
    \item How many books are on the shelf with the extra books?
    \item Will all the books from the shelf with extras fit into the two bins? Explain why or why not.
