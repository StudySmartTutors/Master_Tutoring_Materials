% General Comment: Template for creating problem sets in a structured format with headers, titles, and sections.
% This document uses Montserrat font and consistent styles for exercises, problems, and performance tasks.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
% ChatGPT Directions:
% 1. Always include a header with standards and topic title: \fancyhead[L]{\textbf{<Standards>: <Topic Title>}}.
% 2. Subsection titles should always start with "Problem Set:" followed by the topic title.
% 3. Use tcolorbox for distinct sections: Learning Objective, Exercises, Problems, Performance Task, and Reflection.
% 4. Style guidelines:
%    - Frame color: black or dark gray (colframe=black!60).
%    - Background color: light gray or white (colback=gray!5 or colback=white).
%    - Title background: slightly darker gray (colbacktitle=black!15).
%    - Font style: Bold for titles (fonttitle=\bfseries\Large).
% 5. Ensure a balance of procedural (Exercises), conceptual (Problems), and real-world application tasks (Performance Task).

\subsection*{Problem Set: Solve Two-Step Word Problems Using Four Operations}
\onehalfspacing

% Learning Objective Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Objective:} Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity and assess the reasonableness of answers using estimation.
\end{tcolorbox}

% Exercises Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Exercises, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=60pt]
\textbf{Directions:} Complete the exercises below. Follow the instructions for each group of problems.

% Basic Computations
\textbf{Solve as indicated:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2em]
\item \( (5 \times 3) + 10 = \)
    \item \( 45 - 6 \times 4 = \)
    \item \( 25 + (8 \div 2) = \)
    \item \( (7 \times 2) - 5 = \)
    \item \( 36 \div 6 + 12 = \)
    \item \( 10 + (4 \times 3) - 6 = \)
    \item \( 20 \div (2 + 3) = \)
    \item A school has 45 students in the morning class and 35 in the afternoon class. How many students are there in total? 

\end{enumerate}

% Problems Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Problems, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=60pt]
\textbf{Directions:} Solve the following problems. Show your work using pictures, numbers, or words.

\begin{enumerate}[start=6, itemsep=6em]
    \item A baker bakes 24 muffins and sells 10. In the afternoon, they bake 18 more. How many muffins does the baker have now? Show your steps.
    \item A farmer has 60 chickens. They sell 20 chickens and divide the rest equally into 4 pens. How many chickens are in each pen? Show your work.
    \item A gardener plants 5 rows of flowers, with 10 flowers in each row. Later, they remove 4 flowers from each row. How many flowers are left? Use a drawing or numbers to explain your answer.
    \item A basketball team scores 25 points in the first quarter and 35 points in the second quarter. If each basket is worth 5 points, how many baskets did they make? Solve and explain your answer.
    \item A library has 120 books. After giving 8 books to each of 10 classes, how many books remain? Solve and explain.

% Performance Task Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white,

title=Performance Task: Planning a School Event, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=50pt]
You are organizing a school event. Hereâ€™s what you know:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 200 students and 20 teachers are attending.
    \item Each person will get 3 slices of pizza.
    \item Pizzas are cut into 8 slices each.
    \item Each pizza costs \$12.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=4.5em]
    \item How many total slices of pizza are needed? Show how you found your answer.
    \item How many pizzas do you need to order? Use pictures, numbers, or words to explain your answer.
    \item What is the total cost of the pizzas? Show how you calculated the cost.
    \item The event budget is \$400. How much money will be left, or how much extra will you need? Explain your answer.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

% Reflection Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Reflection, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=80pt]
What strategies did you use to solve these two-step word problems? How did equations help you organize the information? What real-world connections did you notice while solving these problems?
