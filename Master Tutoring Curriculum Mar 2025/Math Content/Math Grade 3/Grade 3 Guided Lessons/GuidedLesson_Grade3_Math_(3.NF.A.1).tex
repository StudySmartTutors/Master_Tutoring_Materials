% This template is designed for creating guided lessons that align strictly with specific standards.
% Key points to ensure proper usage:
% 
% 1. **Key Concepts and Vocabulary**:
%    - Include only the concepts necessary for meeting the standards.
%    - Each Key Concept section must align explicitly with the standards being addressed.
%    - If unrelated standards are introduced (e.g., introducing new operations or properties),
%      create additional Key Concept sections labeled ""Part 2,"" ""Part 3,"" etc.
% 2. **Examples**:
%    - Provide concrete worked examples to illustrate the Key Concepts.
%    - These should directly tie back to the Key Concepts presented earlier.
% 3. **Guided Practice**:
%    - Problems should reinforce Key Concepts and Examples.
%    - Allow for ample spacing between problems to give students room for work.
% 4. **Additional Notes**:
%    - Use this section for helpful but non-essential concepts, strategies, or teacher notes.
%    - Examples: Fact families, properties of operations, or alternative explanations.
% 5. **Independent Practice**:
%    - Provide problems for students to practice Key Concepts individually.
% 6. **Exit Ticket**:
%    - Include a reflective or assessment-based question to evaluate student understanding.

coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large,

\textbf{Objective:} Understand fractions as parts of a whole and represent them on a number line.

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fraction as Part of a Whole:} A fraction represents one or more equal parts of a whole. For example, \( \frac{1}{4} \) represents one part out of four equal parts.
    \item \textbf{Number Line Representation:} Fractions can be shown on a number line by dividing the segment between 0 and 1 into equal parts.
    \item \textbf{Numerator and Denominator:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Numerator:} The top number shows how many parts are taken.
        \item \textbf{Denominator:} The bottom number shows the total number of equal parts.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simplest Form:} A fraction is in its simplest form when the numerator and denominator share no common factors other than 1.
    \item \textbf{Equivalence:} Fractions like \( \frac{2}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{2} \) represent the same part of a whole.
\end{itemize}

% Examples
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Example 1: Fraction as a Part of a Whole}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A pizza is divided into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, what fraction of the pizza have you eaten?
    \item Solution: You have eaten \( \frac{3}{8} \) of the pizza.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Representing Fractions on a Number Line}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: Divide the segment from 0 to 1 into 4 equal parts and mark \( \frac{3}{4} \) on the number line.
    \item Solution: Draw a number line from 0 to 1. Divide it into 4 equal parts. Count 3 parts starting from 0 and mark \( \frac{3}{4} \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 3: Simplifying Fractions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: Simplify \( \frac{6}{8} \).
    \item Solution: Divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (2). \( \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 4: Equivalence of Fractions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: Show that \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{10} \) are equivalent.
    \item Solution: Multiply the numerator and denominator of \( \frac{2}{5} \) by 2: \( \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{10} \).
\end{itemize}

    \item A cake is divided into 6 equal parts. If you eat 2 parts, what fraction of the cake have you eaten? Represent this fraction on a number line.
    \item Divide the segment from 0 to 1 into 5 equal parts. Mark \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{5} \) on the number line.
    \item A ribbon is cut into 10 equal pieces. If you use 7 pieces, what fraction of the ribbon have you used? Represent it on a number line.
    \item Simplify the fraction \( \frac{4}{8} \). Explain your reasoning.
    \item Show that \( \frac{3}{6} \) is equivalent to \( \frac{1}{2} \). Use a number line or visual representation to explain.

    \item Mark \( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3} \), and \( 1 \) on a number line divided into 3 equal parts.
    \item A rope is cut into 8 equal sections. If you use 6 sections, what fraction of the rope have you used? Show this fraction on a number line.
