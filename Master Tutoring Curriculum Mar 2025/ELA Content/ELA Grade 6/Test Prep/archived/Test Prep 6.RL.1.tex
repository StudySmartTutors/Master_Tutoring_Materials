% Passage
\subsection*{The Mysterious Door}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    One evening, as the sun began to set, Sara and her brother Ben were playing outside their house when they noticed something strange. Behind the tall hedges in their backyard, there was a door they had never seen before. It was a small wooden door, with a rusty handle, hidden among the overgrown bushes.

    "Have you ever seen that door before?" Ben asked, his voice filled with curiosity.

    "No," Sara replied, stepping closer to examine it. "I don't think it's even been here before. We would have noticed."

    The door was old, its wood cracked and peeling. But what caught their attention was the strange symbol carved into the door. It looked like a crescent moon with stars surrounding it.

    "I wonder where it leads," Sara said, feeling a mixture of excitement and fear. 

    Ben reached for the handle and turned it. The door creaked open, revealing a dark, narrow passage beyond. The air smelled musty, and the walls seemed to close in as they stepped through the door.

    "Are we sure we want to do this?" Ben asked, hesitating.

    "We won't know unless we try," Sara answered, taking a deep breath and stepping forward.

    As they ventured into the dark passage, they saw a faint light flickering in the distance. It was a strange, eerie glow that seemed to pull them forward. With each step, the passage seemed to get narrower, and the walls seemed to whisper with the sound of the wind.

    "What do you think is at the end?" Ben asked.

    "I don't know, but I think we're about to find out," Sara replied, her heart racing with anticipation.
