\section*{Informational Text: The Fascinating World of Owls}

\textbf{Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.}

Owls are unique birds that have intrigued people for centuries. Known for their nocturnal habits and silent flight, they are often associated with mystery and wisdom in many cultures. These birds are found on every continent except Antarctica. There are over 200 species of owls, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Some owls are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, while others, like the Eurasian eagle-owl, have wingspans that can reach over six feet.

Owls are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night. Their large eyes are adapted for seeing in low light, allowing them to hunt in the dark. Unlike humans, owls can rotate their heads up to 270 degrees to help them spot prey. Their vision is incredibly sharp, and they can see both in the dark and at long distances.

Owls are also known for their silent flight. This is due to the unique structure of their wings. Their feathers are soft, with a velvety texture, which helps to reduce noise when they fly. The leading edges of their wings have structures that break up the turbulence of the air, further helping to silence their flight. This allows owls to hunt stealthily without alerting their prey.

In addition to their impressive flying abilities, owls have a powerful sense of hearing. They can hear sounds at very low frequencies, which helps them locate prey in the dark. Some owls, like the barn owl, have asymmetrical ears, meaning one ear is higher than the other. This allows them to pinpoint the exact location of sounds, making them highly effective hunters.

While owls are incredible hunters, they are also vulnerable to environmental threats. Habitat destruction, loss of prey, and human activity can all affect owl populations. Some species, like the spotted owl, are currently endangered due to these factors. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent birds and ensure their survival for future generations.
