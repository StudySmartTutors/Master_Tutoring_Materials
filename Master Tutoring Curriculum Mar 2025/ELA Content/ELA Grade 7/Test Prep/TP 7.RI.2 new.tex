\subsection*{Understanding Central Ideas and Summarizing Informational Texts}
\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Determine central ideas of a text, analyze their development over the course of the text, and summarize the text objectively.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. \textbf{What is the central idea of the passage?\\}
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating tasks, improving efficiency, and solving complex problems. In healthcare, AI analyzes vast amounts of patient data, assisting doctors in diagnosing illnesses faster and more accurately. In transportation, self-driving vehicles equipped with AI navigate roads safely, reducing traffic accidents and congestion. Retailers use AI to predict customer preferences, ensuring shelves are stocked with popular items and enhancing the shopping \\experience. Furthermore, AI plays a role in environmental conservation, monitoring deforestation and tracking wildlife populations. However, this rapid adoption raises concerns about job displacement, as automation replaces traditional roles, and \\ethical dilemmas such as data privacy and algorithmic bias. Despite these challenges, many experts agree that AI has the potential to improve quality of life and address global issues. The key lies in implementing AI responsibly, ensuring it complements human skills rather than replacing them. With careful oversight, AI could lead to significant advancements in society, benefiting industries and individuals alike."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item AI benefits only the healthcare industry.  
    \item AI is improving industries but comes with challenges.  
    \item AI is causing more harm than good.  
    \item AI eliminates ethical concerns in modern society.  
\end{enumerate}

2. \textbf{Which detail supports the central idea that Japanese-Italian fusion cuisine bridges cultures?\\}
"Japanese-Italian fusion cuisine has become a global phenomenon, combining the simplicity of Italian cooking with the refined techniques of Japanese culinary \\traditions. Chefs often use ingredients like miso, soy sauce, and yuzu to reinvent Italian classics. For example, a traditional carbonara might feature smoked fish instead of pancetta, or miso could add depth to a creamy Alfredo sauce. This fusion also highlights the importance of texture, a hallmark of Japanese cuisine, paired with bold Italian flavors. Fusion dishes like sushi topped with balsamic glaze or pizza with tempura shrimp illustrate the creativity of this approach. The cuisine’s popularity has grown thanks to innovative chefs who celebrate both cultures while creating something entirely new. Beyond the flavors, this fusion demonstrates how food can connect people, blending two distinct culinary heritages into a shared experience. While purists may resist the idea of altering tradition, Japanese-Italian fusion shows that food evolves as cultures interact."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Traditional Italian cuisine never includes Japanese ingredients.  
    \item Japanese-Italian fusion celebrates creativity and cultural exchange.  
    \item Fusion cuisine undermines the traditions of both countries.  
    \item Only sushi and pasta are suitable for Japanese-Italian fusion.  
\end{enumerate}

3. \textbf{How does the author develop the central idea about Formula 1 racing as a blend of technology and athleticism?\\}
"Formula 1 racing is more than just cars speeding around a track—it’s a perfect blend of cutting-edge technology and exceptional human skill. Drivers must \\maintain peak physical fitness to endure the intense g-forces experienced during races, while also possessing lightning-fast reflexes and strategic thinking. Behind the scenes, engineers and designers push the limits of technology, creating cars with aerodynamic precision and advanced hybrid engines. The competition extends to pit crews, who execute tire changes and repairs in under three seconds, \\showcasing teamwork and precision. Formula 1 also serves as a testing ground for innovations, many of which influence everyday car designs, like improved safety features and fuel efficiency. This unique combination of human and technological excellence is what makes Formula 1 truly extraordinary."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Formula 1 focuses only on car design, not athleticism.  
    \item Formula 1 racing requires teamwork, technology, and skill.  
    \item Formula 1 technology has no impact outside of racing.  
    \item Formula 1 racing is purely about speed, not precision.  
\end{enumerate}
