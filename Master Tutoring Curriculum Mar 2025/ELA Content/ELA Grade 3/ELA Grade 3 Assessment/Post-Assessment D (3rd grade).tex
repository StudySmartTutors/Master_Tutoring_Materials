Once upon a time, a turtle and a rabbit decided to race. The rabbit, known for his speed, darted ahead, leaving the slow turtle far behind. Feeling confident, the rabbit stopped to rest under a shady tree. "I have plenty of time to win," he thought. Meanwhile, the turtle kept moving steadily, step by step, without stopping or doubting himself. As the rabbit dozed off, the turtle quietly passed him. When the rabbit finally woke up, he saw the turtle approaching the finish line. Panicked, the rabbit sprinted as fast as he could, but it was too late. The turtle crossed the finish line first, winning the race. Everyone cheered for the turtle, who had shown that perseverance and determination are more important than speed.
