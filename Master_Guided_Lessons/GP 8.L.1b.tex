title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]

title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verb Voice:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Active Voice:} The subject performs the action. \textit{"She wrote the essay."}
        \item \textbf{Passive Voice:} The subject receives the action. \textit{"The essay was written by her."}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verb Mood:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Indicative:} States facts or opinions. \textit{"I am going to the store."}
        \item \textbf{Imperative:} Gives commands or instructions. \textit{"Go to the store."}
        \item \textbf{Interrogative:} Asks a question. \textit{"Are you going to the store?"}
        \item \textbf{Conditional:} Describes what could happen under certain conditions. \textit{"If it rains, the game will be canceled."}
        \item \textbf{Subjunctive:} Expresses wishes, hypotheticals, or actions contrary to reality. \textit{"I wish I were taller."}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shifts:} 
    Avoid unnecessary shifts in verb voice (e.g., switching from active to passive) or mood (e.g., moving from indicative to imperative) unless there is a clear purpose.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples of Appropriate Voice and Mood Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consistent Voice:}  
    Active: The team won the game and celebrated afterward.  
    Passive: The trophy was awarded to the team, and a ceremony was held.

    Indicative: I will study hard, and I will do my best on the test.  
    Conditional: If I study hard, I will do my best on the test.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples of Inappropriate Shifts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Voice:} The team won the game, and a celebration was held by them.  
    (Corrected: The team won the game and held a celebration.)
