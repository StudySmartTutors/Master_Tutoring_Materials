\section*{Answer Key}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. **B.** Coral reefs are important to ecosystems and need protection.

2. **B.** Renewable energy sources reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

3. **B.** National parks face challenges that require conservation efforts.

\subsection*{Part 2: Select All That Apply Questions}

4. **A, B, D.**  
   - They provide shelter for marine life.  
   - They support fishing and tourism industries.  
   - They protect coastlines from erosion.  

5. **A, B, D.**  
   - Renewable energy produces little to no greenhouse gases.  
   - Renewable energy helps conserve natural resources.  
   - Renewable energy is sustainable.  

6. **A, B.**  
   - Visitors should follow park rules to reduce littering.  
   - Governments should allocate resources for conservation.  

\subsection*{Part 3: Short Answer Questions}

7. **Sample Answer:** Coral reefs face threats from overfishing, pollution, and climate change, particularly coral bleaching caused by rising ocean temperatures. Protecting reefs involves actions such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, regulating fishing, and minimizing pollution. Efforts like establishing marine reserves and promoting sustainable practices are essential to their preservation.

8. **Sample Answer:** National parks protect biodiversity by providing safe habitats for endangered species and supporting ecosystems. They also offer recreational opportunities, such as hiking and camping, which help people connect with nature and foster environmental stewardship. These parks benefit both the environment and future generations.

\subsection*{Part 4: Fill in the Blank Questions}

9. The main idea tells what the text is mostly about, while \underline{key details} explain the main idea.

10. A good summary includes the main idea and \underline{supporting evidence} from the text.
