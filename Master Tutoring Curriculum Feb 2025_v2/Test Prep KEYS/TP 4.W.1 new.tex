\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Write an opinion essay that states a clear opinion, supports it with reasons and evidence, and provides a conclusion.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Prompt}

After reading the passages below, write an opinion essay responding to the question:  
"Should students have longer recess at school?" 
Use evidence from the texts to \\support your opinion.

\subsection*{Passage 1: The Benefits of Longer Recess}

Many students believe that having longer recess is a great idea. Recess helps kids get exercise, which keeps them healthy and gives them more energy for learning. Running, jumping, and playing outside also improve focus in class because kids burn off extra energy. When students have more time to play, they also build \\friendships and practice teamwork. For example, playing soccer or tag teaches kids how to work together and solve problems. Longer recess can even reduce stress, helping students feel happier and more ready to learn. While some worry that longer recess might take time away from schoolwork, studies show that active kids often do better in school. More recess time can create healthier, happier, and smarter students.

\subsection*{Passage 2: The Challenges of Longer Recess}

Some teachers and parents worry that longer recess might not be the best idea. They believe that adding more playtime could take away from important learning activities, like reading or math. For example, if recess is too long, students might not have enough time to finish lessons or homework. Another concern is safety. When kids play for a longer time, there is a higher chance of accidents, like falling or getting hurt. Additionally, some kids may use recess time to cause trouble, such as arguing or teasing others. While recess is important, making it too long could create challenges for teachers and students. A shorter, focused recess might be a better balance.
