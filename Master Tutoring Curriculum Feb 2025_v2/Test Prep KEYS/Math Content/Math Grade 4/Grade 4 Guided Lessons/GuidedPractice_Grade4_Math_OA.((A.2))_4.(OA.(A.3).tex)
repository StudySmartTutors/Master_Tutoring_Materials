% ChatGPT Directions:
% 1. Always include a header with standards and topic title: \fancyhead[L]{\textbf{<Standards>: <Topic Title>}}.
% 2. Subsection titles should always start with "Problem Set:" followed by the topic title.
% 3. Use tcolorbox for distinct sections: Learning Objective, Exercises, Problems, Performance Task, and Reflection.
% 4. Style guidelines:
%    - Frame color: black or dark gray (colframe=black!60).
%    - Background color: light gray or white (colback=gray!5 or colback=white).
%    - Title background: slightly darker gray (colbacktitle=black!15).
%    - Font style: Bold for titles (fonttitle=\bfseries\Large).

\subsection*{Guided Lesson: Solving Multi-Step Word Problems Using the Four Operations}
\onehalfspacing

% Learning Objective Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Objective:} Solve multi-step word problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and represent solutions using equations with variables.
\end{tcolorbox}

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Step Problems:} Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
    \item \textbf{Remainders in Context:} Interpret remainders based on the context of the problem:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ignore the remainder if it's not relevant.
        \item Round up if you need a full group.
        \item Use the remainder if it represents something leftover.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiplicative Comparison:} Compare two quantities by showing how many times one is larger or smaller than the other. For example, "5 times as many" means multiplying by 5.
    \item \textbf{Using Variables:} Represent unknown quantities with a variable in an equation.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

% Examples Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Example 1: Solving a Multiplicative Comparison Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A car is traveling 3 times as fast as a bike. If the bike travels 12 miles per hour, how fast is the car traveling?
    \item Solution: \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \). The car is traveling 36 miles per hour.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Interpreting Remainders in Context}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A group of 23 students is going on a trip. Each van holds 6 students. How many vans are needed?
    \item Solution: \( 23 \div 6 = 3 \) remainder \( 5 \). Since 5 students still need a ride, 4 vans are needed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 3: Multi-Step Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A store sells packs of 8 markers for \$10. A teacher buys 24 markers. How much does the teacher pay?
    \item Solution:
    \[
    24 \div 8 = 3 \text{ packs.} \quad 3 \times 10 = 30. 
    \]
    The teacher pays \$30.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

% Guided Practice Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Guided Practice, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=80pt]
\textbf{Work through the following problems with teacher support:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3em]
    \item A dog weighs 4 times as much as a cat. If the cat weighs 8 pounds, how much does the dog weigh?
    \item A gardener plants 95 seeds in rows of 8. How many full rows are planted, and how many seeds are left over?
    \item A bus can hold 50 people. If 325 people need transportation, how many buses are needed?
    \item A bakery sells 12 muffins for \$8. How much does a customer pay for 36 muffins?
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

% Independent Practice Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Independent Practice, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=80pt]
\textbf{Solve the following problems independently:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3em]
    \item A book is 5 times as long as another book that has 100 pages. How many pages does the longer book have?
    \item A family divides 450 miles equally among 5 days of driving. How many miles do they drive each day?
    \item Write and solve an equation: "The total cost of 4 movie tickets is \$36. Find the cost of one ticket."
    \item A farmer has 127 apples and divides them into boxes of 12. How many full boxes are there? How many apples are left over?
    \item A car factory produces 256 cars in 8 days. How many cars are produced each day?
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Exit Ticket, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=80pt]
\textbf{Reflect and Solve:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do you decide what to do with a remainder in a division problem? Write an example to explain your reasoning.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
