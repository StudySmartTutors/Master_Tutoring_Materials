\subsection*{Passage: The Power of Renewable Energy}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Renewable energy is energy that is collected from natural resources that are constantly replenished. These include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, geothermal heat, and more. As concerns over climate change and environmental degradation rise, renewable energy sources are becoming a critical part of the global energy system.

    Solar power, for example, harnesses energy from the sun’s rays using solar panels. These panels absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity that can power homes, businesses, and even entire cities. Wind power is another widely used renewable source, where turbines capture the wind's energy and convert it into electrical power.

    One of the major benefits of renewable energy is that it produces little or no pollution, unlike fossil fuels, which release harmful gases into the atmosphere. It also reduces dependency on non-renewable resources, which are finite and will eventually run out.

    However, renewable energy also faces challenges. Some sources, like solar and wind, depend on weather conditions and geographic location, meaning they are not always available when needed. Additionally, the cost of installing renewable energy systems can be high, although prices have been decreasing in recent years. Despite these challenges, the widespread adoption of renewable energy offers a promising path toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.
