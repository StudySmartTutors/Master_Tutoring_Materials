\subsection*{Passage: A New Pet in the House}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Max had always wanted a pet. His friends at school talked about their dogs and cats, and Max couldn't help but imagine the fun he could have with his own furry companion. For months, he begged his parents, but they were hesitant. They were busy with work and didn't think they had enough time for a pet. 

    One Saturday morning, however, his parents surprised him. They had adopted a small puppy from the shelter. Max was overjoyed! The puppy, a little brown and white terrier, wagged its tail excitedly when Max came into the room. Max knelt down, and the puppy licked his face, making him laugh uncontrollably. 

    Over the next few days, Max took the puppy outside to play, fed it, and made sure it had enough water. His parents taught him how to clean up after the puppy and take care of its needs. Max loved every moment of it. The puppy, whom he named Charlie, quickly became part of the family.

    However, as much as Max loved Charlie, there were challenges. Max had to balance his schoolwork, sports, and taking care of the puppy. Some nights, he stayed up late to finish his homework because he had spent so much time with Charlie. At first, Max felt frustrated, but soon he realized that he could manage his time better. He learned how to schedule his activities to ensure he took care of Charlie and still had time for his responsibilities.

    Max's family grew closer as they shared the task of caring for Charlie. They spent weekends at the park, watching the puppy chase after sticks and run in circles. Max’s parents were happy to see how responsible he had become, and Max felt proud of himself. 

    Having Charlie in the house brought joy and some challenges, but it also taught Max valuable lessons about responsibility and time management.
