\subsection*{Informational Texts on the Costs and Benefits of Extracurricular Activities}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}

\textbf{Text 1: Benefits of Extracurricular Activities}

Extracurricular activities are activities that students participate in outside of their regular schoolwork. These activities, such as sports, music, drama, and clubs, can provide a number of benefits for students. First, they help students develop new skills. For example, playing a musical instrument can improve a student's ability to focus and be disciplined, while sports help build teamwork and physical fitness.

Second, extracurricular activities give students the chance to explore their interests. A student who enjoys painting might join an art club, or a student interested in science might become a part of a science club. These activities allow students to pursue their passions and discover new things they enjoy.

Finally, being involved in extracurricular activities helps students make new friends and become part of a community. It can help students build strong relationships and develop good social skills.

\textbf{Text 2: Costs of Extracurricular Activities}

While extracurricular activities are valuable, they can also come with some costs. One of the most significant costs is the time commitment. Many extracurricular activities, such as sports or drama, require practice, rehearsals, or meetings after school. This can take away from a student's time for homework, family, or rest.

Another cost is financial. Some extracurricular activities require students to pay for things like uniforms, equipment, or event tickets. These expenses can add up, making extracurricular activities difficult for some families to afford.

Finally, students may experience stress from balancing multiple extracurricular activities with their academic responsibilities. This pressure to manage time effectively can cause anxiety for some students, especially if they have a lot of commitments.
