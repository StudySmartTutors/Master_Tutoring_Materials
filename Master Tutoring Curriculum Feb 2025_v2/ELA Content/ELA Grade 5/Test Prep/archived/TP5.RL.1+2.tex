\subsection*{Fictional Text: The Brave Dog}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}

In a small village nestled between tall mountains, there lived a dog named Max. Max wasn’t just any ordinary dog — he was known throughout the village for his courage. The villagers loved Max, and he had been their faithful companion for many years. Max’s owner, Mrs. Miller, always praised him for his bravery.

One winter evening, a terrible storm swept through the village. Snow and wind howled through the streets, and the temperature dropped quickly. Mrs. Miller, who lived on the edge of the village, had trouble getting home. She was walking through the woods when she slipped and twisted her ankle. She was stuck, unable to move, and her only hope was Max.

Max had been following Mrs. Miller, and when he heard her calls for help, he raced into the woods. The snow was deep, and the wind was fierce, but Max didn’t hesitate. He found Mrs. Miller lying in the snow, shivering from the cold. Without wasting a moment, Max lay beside her to keep her warm, using his body to shield her from the freezing wind.

Max knew he had to get Mrs. Miller back to the village, but the storm made it impossible to walk through the snow. So, Max did something even braver — he ran back to the village as fast as he could and barked until someone came to help. The villagers quickly followed Max, and they found Mrs. Miller just in time. They carried her back to safety, and Max stayed by her side until she recovered.

From that day on, Max became even more beloved by the villagers, and his courage was remembered as one of the greatest acts of bravery the village had ever seen.
