\subsection*{The Brave Little Lion}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}
   Once upon a time in a faraway jungle, there was a little lion named Leo. Leo was smaller than the other lions in his pride, and because of this, he often felt different. While the other lions were strong and brave, Leo was often scared of things that most animals didn’t fear. He hated being alone, and when it came to challenges, he preferred to stay in the background.

One day, a great storm swept through the jungle. The winds howled, and heavy rain poured down, making the trees sway and the rivers rise. The sky grew dark, and the jungle became eerily quiet. All the animals were frightened and hurried to find shelter. Leo’s family was caught in their den, and they couldn’t get out because the storm had made the ground too muddy and slippery.

Inside their den, Leo’s family huddled together, worried about what the storm might bring. Leo, however, could hear the panic in the air. He knew that if they didn’t get help soon, they might be trapped. His heart raced as he realized that his family needed him, even though he was small. Leo had always been afraid of storms, but now he couldn’t wait any longer. He had to help.

With a deep breath, Leo ran out into the storm. The rain stung his fur, and the wind pushed against him, but he kept going. As he ran through the jungle, he called out, “Help! My family needs help!” His voice was shaky, but he didn’t stop. He pushed on, even though he was scared. Leo wasn’t sure if anyone would hear him or if anyone would come, but he refused to give up.

As Leo made his way through the jungle, other animals heard his cries. First, a wise old elephant appeared, followed by a group of monkeys. They knew that Leo was in trouble, and they rushed to help him. Together, the animals worked as a team. The elephant used his trunk to move fallen branches out of the way, while the monkeys helped by climbing trees to find a safe path. The rain poured down harder, but they didn’t stop.

Finally, after what felt like hours, they reached Leo’s den. The animals helped Leo’s family to safety, guiding them to a higher, drier place. Once they were safe, Leo took a moment to catch his breath. He was exhausted, but he felt something else, too—pride. Even though he was smaller than the other animals, Leo had done something very brave. He had faced his fears and helped others when it was needed most.

As the storm passed and the jungle slowly returned to normal, Leo realized something important. Bravery wasn’t about being the biggest or the strongest. It was about doing the right thing, even when you were afraid. Leo may not have been the biggest lion in the jungle, but he knew now that his courage came from within, and that was what mattered most.

From that day on, Leo was no longer afraid of challenges. He knew that even a little lion could make a big difference.
