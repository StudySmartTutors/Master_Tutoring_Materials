    \item Includes a clear structure with an introduction, body (reasons and evidence), and conclusion.
    \item The writing stays focused on the assigned topic or prompt.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fail:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No opinion is stated, or the response lacks structure or focus.
\end{itemize}

    \item Uses evidence from at least one source to support the reasons.
    \item Explains how the evidence connects to the opinion.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Fail:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fewer than two reasons are provided, or the reasons lack evidence or explanation.
    \item No evidence from the sources is included, or evidence is irrelevant.
