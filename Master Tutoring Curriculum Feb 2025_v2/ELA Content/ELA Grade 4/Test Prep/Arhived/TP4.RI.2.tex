\subsection*{Informational Text: The Fascinating World of Mushrooms}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Mushrooms are a type of fungi, a group of organisms that are different from plants, animals, and bacteria. They grow in damp environments, often found in forests, grasslands, and even in your backyard. Unlike plants, mushrooms do not make their food through photosynthesis. Instead, they absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter, such as dead plants and trees.

    There are many different types of mushrooms. Some are edible, while others are poisonous. The edible varieties, like button mushrooms and portobellos, are commonly used in cooking, while poisonous mushrooms can be very dangerous if eaten.

    Mushrooms play an important role in nature by breaking down dead plant and animal matter, returning nutrients to the soil. This helps plants grow. In addition, some mushrooms form relationships with tree roots in a process called mycorrhizal symbiosis, where the mushrooms help trees absorb water and nutrients, while the trees provide food for the mushrooms.

    Though mushrooms are important to the environment, they can also pose risks. Some poisonous mushrooms can cause serious health problems if consumed. For this reason, it is important to never eat wild mushrooms without expert knowledge.

    In recent years, mushrooms have gained popularity for their medicinal benefits. Certain types of mushrooms, such as reishi and shiitake, are known to have healing properties. They are used in traditional medicine to boost the immune system and promote overall health.
