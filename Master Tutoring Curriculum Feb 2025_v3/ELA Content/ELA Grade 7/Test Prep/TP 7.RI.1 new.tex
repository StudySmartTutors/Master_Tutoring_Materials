\subsection*{Analyzing and Citing Textual Evidence in Informational Texts}
\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Cite several pieces of textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly and inferences drawn from it.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. \textbf{What inference can be made about the impact of urban farming?\\}
"Urban farming is transforming how cities grow and consume food. This practice involves cultivating plants and sometimes raising animals within city limits. Rooftop gardens, community plots, and hydroponic systems are examples of urban farming. These efforts reduce food miles—the distance food travels from farm to table—\\ resulting in lower transportation costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Urban farms also provide access to fresh produce in areas known as food deserts, where grocery stores are scarce. Additionally, these farms create green spaces that improve air quality and reduce urban heat. However, challenges exist. Limited space, high \\start-up costs, and water access can hinder progress. Still, urban farming’s benefits outweigh its drawbacks. It not only addresses environmental concerns but also fosters community engagement, as neighbors work together to cultivate crops. With increasing urbanization, urban farming could play a key role in creating sustainable cities and improving the quality of life for residents."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Urban farming improves community relationships and food access.  
    \item Urban farming is too costly to implement in cities.  
    \item Urban farming negatively impacts the environment.  
    \item Urban farming increases transportation costs.  
\end{enumerate}

2. \textbf{What evidence supports the claim that seahorses have unique life cycles?}\\
"Seahorses, small fish with horse-like heads, are known for their unusual reproductive behaviors. Unlike most species, it’s the male seahorse that becomes pregnant. \\During mating, the female deposits her eggs into the male’s brood pouch,  
 \\specialized structure on his body. The male fertilizes the eggs internally and carries them for several weeks, providing oxygen and nutrients. Once the young are ready, he gives birth by expelling the tiny seahorses from his pouch. This role reversal ensures both parents contribute to the survival of their offspring. Seahorses also have prehensile tails, allowing them to cling to seagrass or coral, protecting them from predators. However, their populations face threats from habitat destruction and overfishing. Conservation efforts focus on preserving their delicate ecosystems and raising awareness about their \\importance to marine biodiversity. These unique creatures highlight the diversity of life cycles in the animal kingdom and the importance of protecting vulnerable species."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Male seahorses lay eggs in coral reefs.  
    \item Male seahorses carry eggs in a brood pouch.  
    \item Seahorses give birth to live young like mammals.  
    \item Seahorses are unaffected by habitat destruction.  
\end{enumerate}

3. \textbf{How does the author explain the process of making bagels?\\}
"Bagels are beloved around the world for their chewy texture and rich flavor. The process begins with mixing a simple dough of flour, water, yeast, salt, and a touch of sugar. After kneading, the dough is shaped into rings and left to proof, or rise. What sets bagels apart from other bread is the boiling step. Once the dough has risen, the rings are boiled briefly in water, often mixed with barley malt syrup or honey for a shiny crust. Boiling locks in moisture, giving bagels their signature chewy interior. After boiling, they are baked until golden brown. Popular toppings like sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything seasoning are added before baking. While bagels originated in Eastern Europe, they have become a breakfast staple worldwide. From plain to savory to sweet varieties, bagels reflect cultural traditions and innovations in baking, showing how a simple recipe can evolve into a global favorite."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Bagels are boiled after baking to achieve a chewy texture.  
    \item The boiling step gives bagels their signature crust and chew.  
    \item Bagels are only made with plain dough and no toppings.  
    \item Bagels do not require proofing before baking.  
\end{enumerate}
