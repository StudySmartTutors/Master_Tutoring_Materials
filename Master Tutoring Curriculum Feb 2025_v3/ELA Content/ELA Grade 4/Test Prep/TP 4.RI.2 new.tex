\subsection*{Understanding the Main Idea and Summarizing}
\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Determine the main idea of a text and explain how it is supported by key details. Summarize the text clearly and concisely.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. What is the main idea of the following passage?\\
"Clean energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming more popular. These energy sources do not pollute the environment like fossil fuels. Solar panels and wind turbines are being used in homes, businesses, and even schools. Clean energy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Additionally, clean energy is renewable, meaning it will not run out like fossil fuels. Governments and organizations are investing in clean energy technologies to create jobs and improve public health by reducing air pollution. By switching to clean energy, we can protect the planet for future generations."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Clean energy is expensive.  
    \item Fossil fuels are the best energy source.  
    \item Clean energy is better for the environment.  
    \item Clean energy cannot be used in homes.  
\end{enumerate}

2. Which detail supports the main idea of the passage below?\\
"Exercise is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It strengthens muscles, improves heart health, and boosts energy levels. Regular exercise can also reduce stress and improve mental health. Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day to stay healthy and feel good. Exercise can be done in various forms, such as walking, running, swimming, or playing sports. In addition to physical benefits, exercise encourages better sleep patterns and helps individuals build \\confidence. Communities that promote exercise programs often see improved overall well-being and reduced healthcare costs."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Exercise can be done at any time of day.  
    \item Exercise helps reduce stress and improve mental health.  
    \item Exercise equipment is expensive.  
    \item Exercise can be done indoors or outdoors.  
\end{enumerate}

3. What is a good summary of this passage?\\
"Rainforests are vital ecosystems that produce oxygen and regulate the Earth’s \\climate. They are home to millions of species of plants and animals. Unfortunately, rainforests are being destroyed by logging and farming. This destruction leads to loss of biodiversity and disrupts the water cycle, causing droughts in some areas. Protecting rainforests is essential for maintaining biodiversity, stabilizing global \\temperatures, and ensuring the health of the planet. Governments, environmental organizations, and individuals must work together to preserve these ecosystems by reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable practices."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Rainforests are being destroyed, which is bad for the planet.  
    \item Rainforests produce oxygen and are home to many species.  
    \item Rainforests are important for the planet and must be protected.  
    \item Rainforests are used for farming and logging.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part 2: Short Answer Questions}

4. Based on the passage below, summarize why clean energy is important: \\
"Clean energy, such as solar and wind power, helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It is a renewable resource, meaning it won’t run out like fossil fuels. Clean energy also creates jobs in industries like manufacturing and installation. By using clean energy, we can protect the environment and support a growing economy. In addition, clean energy reduces dependency on nonrenewable resources, which are limited and contribute to environmental degradation. Investing in clean energy technologies can lead to healthier communities and a more sustainable future."\\

7. Which details are important for summarizing the following passage?\\
"Fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, are nonrenewable resources that take millions of years to form. Using fossil fuels creates pollution and contributes to climate change. Switching to renewable energy sources like solar and wind can help protect the planet and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, renewable energy reduces dependency on finite resources and promotes sustainability. Governments and \\communities are encouraged to invest in renewable energy infrastructure to ensure a cleaner, healthier future for the planet."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Fossil fuels take millions of years to form.  
    \item Fossil fuels create pollution and contribute to climate change.  
    \item Renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
    \item Renewable energy is fun to use.
