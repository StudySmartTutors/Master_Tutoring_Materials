\subsection*{Fictional Text: The Haunted House}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}

It was a cold, foggy evening when Mia and her friends decided to visit the old mansion at the edge of town. The house had been abandoned for years, and the townspeople always whispered about strange noises and flickering lights inside. Mia wasn’t sure if it was a good idea, but her friends insisted. After all, it was Halloween night, and they wanted to experience something thrilling.

As they walked up the creaky stairs to the front door, a chilling wind blew through the trees. Mia could hear the sound of the wind howling, but there was something else — a soft, eerie sound coming from inside the house. They hesitated at the door, but Mia’s best friend, Jake, pushed it open. 

Inside, the house was dark and silent. The air was thick with dust, and the floorboards creaked under their feet as they ventured deeper into the house. The group split up to explore different rooms. Mia wandered into a small bedroom at the end of a narrow hallway. Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind her. She tried to open it, but the handle wouldn’t budge. Panic set in as she realized she was trapped.

As Mia looked around the room for a way out, she noticed a strange glow coming from a cracked mirror on the wall. When she approached, the reflection in the mirror didn’t match what was in the room. Instead, she saw the shadowy figure of a man staring back at her. Mia screamed, and the reflection vanished.

Just as she was about to lose hope, the door creaked open. Her friends had come to rescue her. They quickly ran out of the house, never looking back. As they reached the safety of the street, Mia couldn’t help but wonder if the haunted house had been more than just a story.
