\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Write an informative text that examines a topic, includes facts and details, and explains the information clearly.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Prompt}

After reading the passages below, write an informative text in response to the \\question:  
"Why do animals hibernate?"  
Use details from the passages to \\explain what hibernation is and why animals do it.

\subsection*{Passage 1: What Is Hibernation?}

Hibernation is a special way some animals survive during the winter. When it gets cold and food is hard to find, animals like bears, bats, and turtles go into hibernation. During hibernation, an animal's body slows down. Their heartbeat and breathing become much slower, and they use less energy. This helps them stay alive without eating for a long time. Before hibernating, animals eat a lot of food to store fat in their bodies. This fat gives them energy while they rest. Hibernation is like a long, deep sleep that helps animals survive until spring, when food is easier to find.

\subsection*{Passage 2: Why Do Animals Hibernate?}

Animals hibernate to stay safe and survive when it is cold. In winter, snow covers the ground, and plants stop growing, making it hard for animals to find food. Some animals, like squirrels, store food in their nests to eat later. Others, like bears, hibernate so they donâ€™t have to search for food in the cold. Hibernation also keeps animals safe from the freezing weather. Instead of facing the cold, animals like frogs and turtles hide in warm places and hibernate until spring. Hibernation is an important way for animals to stay alive during the hardest time of the year.
