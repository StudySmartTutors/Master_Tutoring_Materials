\subsection*{Opinion Writing: Should Kids Have Pets?}
\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Write an opinion piece that introduces the topic, states an opinion, and provides reasons and evidence to support it.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Prompt}

After reading the passages below, write an opinion essay responding to the question:  
"Should kids have pets?"  
Use reasons and evidence from the texts to support your opinion.

\subsection*{Passage 1: Why Pets Are Great for Kids}

Many people believe that kids should have pets because pets teach responsibility. For example, when kids take care of a pet, they learn to feed it, give it water, and clean up after it. Pets are also fun to play with. A dog can fetch a ball, and a cat can chase a string. Pets help kids feel happy when they are sad or lonely. Having a pet is like having a best friend who always listens. Studies show that kids who grow up with pets are often more caring and gentle with animals and people. Pets make life better by giving love and teaching important lessons.

\subsection*{Passage 2: Why Having Pets Can Be Hard for Kids}

Not everyone thinks kids should have pets. Taking care of a pet can be a lot of work. Feeding and cleaning up after an animal takes time, and some kids may forget or not want to do it. Pets can also cost a lot of money. Families have to pay for food, toys, and visits to the vet. Pets can sometimes be messy, like when a dog chews on furniture or a cat scratches things. Some kids might not be ready for the responsibility, and the pet could end up feeling sad or not cared for. While pets are great for some families, they may not be the best choice for everyone.
