\subsection*{Passage: The Development of Refrigeration}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    The development of refrigeration has played a critical role in shaping modern society. Early methods of cooling food involved simple techniques like using ice or cool caves to preserve perishables. However, mechanical refrigeration systems, which made it possible to cool and preserve food more effectively, were first developed in the 19th century.

    The first practical refrigeration system was invented by Scottish scientist William Cruickshank in 1805. This system used ether to cool air, creating a more efficient way to preserve food. Over the next few decades, other inventors improved refrigeration technology. In the mid-1800s, commercial refrigeration systems were developed for use in industries like meatpacking and brewing.

    One of the biggest impacts of refrigeration was on food preservation. Before refrigeration, people had to rely on methods like salting, smoking, or drying food to make it last longer. These methods were time-consuming and often did not work as well as refrigeration. With the invention of refrigeration, fresh food like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products could be stored for longer periods, reducing waste and allowing for a more varied diet.

    In the early 20th century, refrigeration technology continued to improve. In 1927, General Electric introduced the first household refrigerator. This innovation changed how families stored food at home, providing a convenient and reliable way to keep food fresh. By the 1950s, refrigerators became common in households across the world, and refrigeration technology was being used in other fields like air conditioning and medicine.

    Today, refrigeration is used not just for food storage, but also in transportation, science, and medicine. Refrigeration systems have become more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, ensuring that refrigeration technology will continue to play an important role in society for years to come.
