\onehalfspacing

% Learning Objective Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Objective:} Solve multi-step proportional problems involving percentages such as tax, tips, discounts, and multi-part cost problems using equations, proportions, and logical reasoning.

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Explain the real-world relevance of this lesson by providing examples like calculating restaurant tips, budgeting with discounts, and understanding sales tax on purchases. Connect the objective to everyday financial literacy.}

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proportional Relationships:} Use proportions to relate parts and wholes in percentage problems. For example:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} = \frac{\text{Percent}}{100}.
    \]
    \item \textbf{Percent Calculations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Tax and Tip:} Add the calculated percentage to the original amount.
        \item \textbf{Discounts:} Subtract the calculated percentage from the original amount.
        \item \textbf{Multi-Step Problems:} When combining multiple steps (e.g., applying a discount and then adding tax), solve one step at a time.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Percent Equation:} Use the equation \(\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{Whole}\) to find missing values.
    \item \textbf{Unit Rates:} Calculate cost per unit by dividing the total cost by the quantity to solve proportional pricing problems.
\end{itemize}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Use visuals, like pie charts or bar models, to illustrate proportional relationships. Reinforce that percentages are parts of 100 and relate this concept to ratios and decimals.}

% Examples
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Example 1: Calculating Tax and Total Cost}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A jacket costs \$80, and the sales tax is 9\%. What is the total cost, including tax?
    \item \textcolor{red}{Solution: Step 1: Calculate the tax: \( 80 \times 0.09 = 7.20 \). \\ Step 2: Add the tax to the original cost: \( 80 + 7.20 = 87.20 \). \\ Final Answer: The total cost is \$87.20.}
\end{itemize}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Emphasize the importance of reading problems carefully to determine if the percentage needs to be added (like tax) or subtracted (like a discount).}

\textbf{Example 2: Solving a Multi-Step Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A television is originally \$500. It is on sale for 20\% off, and there is an additional \$25 rebate. What is the final price?
    \item \textcolor{red}{Solution: Step 1: Calculate the discount: \( 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \). \\ Step 2: Subtract the discount: \( 500 - 100 = 400 \). \\ Step 3: Subtract the rebate: \( 400 - 25 = 375 \). \\ Final Answer: The final price is \$375.}
\end{itemize}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Guide students through multi-step problems by breaking down each part of the solution. Highlight the importance of intermediate steps to avoid mistakes.}

\textbf{Example 3: Unit Rate Calculation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A 12-ounce bottle of juice costs \$4.80. What is the cost per ounce?
    \item \textcolor{red}{Solution: Step 1: Divide the cost by the number of ounces: \( 4.80 \div 12 = 0.40 \). \\ Final Answer: The cost per ounce is \$0.40.}
\end{itemize}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Connect this example to real-life situations, like comparing product prices at the store, and discuss how unit rates can help in decision-making.}

% Guided Practice
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Guided Practice, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Solve the following problems with teacher support:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=5em]
    \item A meal costs \$95. The tax is 8\%, and the customer leaves a 20\% tip on the original price. What is the total cost of the meal? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Tax: \( 95 \times 0.08 = 7.60 \). Tip: \( 95 \times 0.20 = 19.00 \). \\ Total: \( 95 + 7.60 + 19.00 = 121.60 \). Final Answer: \$121.60.}
    \item A pair of shoes costs \$120. It is discounted by 30\% and then further marked down by \$15. What is the final price? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Discount: \( 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \). Sale Price: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \). \\ Additional Markdown: \( 84 - 15 = 69 \). Final Answer: \$69.}
    \item A box of granola bars costs \$6.40 and contains 16 bars. What is the cost per bar? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Cost per bar: \( 6.40 \div 16 = 0.40 \). Final Answer: \$0.40 per bar.}
\end{enumerate}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} As students work through guided practice, ask probing questions like "What does this number represent?" or "Why do we subtract here?" to deepen understanding.}

% Additional Notes
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Additional Notes, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Helpful Tips:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always express percentages as decimals for calculations (e.g., \( 15\% = 0.15 \)).
    \item For multi-step problems, work step by step and use estimation to check each part of the solution.
    \item For unit rates, divide the total cost by the total quantity to determine the cost per unit.
\end{itemize}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Use this section to provide additional strategies, like cross-checking answers with reverse calculations or using estimation for a quick sanity check.}

coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Independent Practice, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Solve the following problems independently:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=5em]
    \item A laptop costs \$850. The tax rate is 9.5\%. What is the total cost, including tax? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Tax: \( 850 \times 0.095 = 80.75 \). Total: \( 850 + 80.75 = 930.75 \). Final Answer: \$930.75.}
    \item A jacket is originally \$150 and is on sale for 40\% off. What is the sale price? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Discount: \( 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \). Sale Price: \( 150 - 60 = 90 \). Final Answer: \$90.}
    \item A family spends \$240 on groceries. They use a 15\% off coupon. How much do they pay after the discount? \\
    \textcolor{red}{Solution: Discount: \( 240 \times 0.15 = 36 \). Total: \( 240 - 36 = 204 \). Final Answer: \$204.}
\end{enumerate}

{\color{blue} \textbf{Instructor Note:} Circulate the room during independent practice to provide support and identify common misconceptions. Use these moments to clarify any errors or misunderstandings.}
