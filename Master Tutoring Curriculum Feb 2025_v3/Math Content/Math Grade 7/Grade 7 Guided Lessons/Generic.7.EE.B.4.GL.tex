% ChatGPT Directions:
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This template is designed for creating guided lessons that align strictly with specific standards.
% Key points to ensure proper usage:
% 
% 1. **Key Concepts and Vocabulary**:
%    - Include only the concepts necessary for meeting the standards.
%    - Each Key Concept section must align explicitly with the standards being addressed.
% 2. **Examples**:
%    - Provide concrete worked examples to illustrate the Key Concepts.
%    - These should directly tie back to the Key Concepts presented earlier.
% 3. **Guided Practice**:
%    - Problems should reinforce Key Concepts and Examples.
%    - Allow for ample spacing between problems to give students room for work.
% 4. **Additional Notes**:
%    - Use this section for helpful but non-essential concepts, strategies, or teacher notes.
%    - Examples: Fact families, properties of operations, or alternative explanations.
% 5. **Independent Practice**:
%    - Provide problems for students to practice Key Concepts individually.
% 6. **Exit Ticket**:
%    - Include a reflective or assessment-based question to evaluate student understanding.

% Learning Objective Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Objective:} Write and solve equations and inequalities to model real-world situations, and solve for unknowns in two-step equations.
\end{tcolorbox}

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Equations:} Represent real-world situations with mathematical expressions that include variables.
    \item \textbf{Two-Step Equations:} Solve equations with two operations by isolating the variable step by step.
    \item \textbf{Inequalities:} Model situations where there is a range of possible solutions using \( \leq, \geq, <, > \).
    \item \textbf{Steps to Solve:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify the variable and translate the problem into an equation or inequality.
        \item Perform inverse operations to isolate the variable.
        \item Check your solution to ensure it fits the problem.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Examples Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Example 1: Solving a Two-Step Equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: Solve \( 5x + 3 = 18 \).
    \item Solution:
    \[
    5x + 3 = 18 \quad \text{(Subtract 3 from both sides)} \quad 5x = 15 \quad \text{(Divide by 5)} \quad x = 3.
    \]
    The solution is \( x = 3 \).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Writing and Solving an Inequality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: A student needs at least 75 points to pass a test. They have scored 48 points. Write and solve an inequality to find how many more points they need.
    \item Solution:
    Let \( x \) represent the additional points needed.
    \[
    48 + x \geq 75 \quad \text{(Subtract 48 from both sides)} \quad x \geq 27.
    \]
    The student needs at least 27 more points to pass.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solve the following problems independently:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3em]
    \item Solve: \( \frac{x}{3} + 5 = 14 \).
    \item Write and solve an equation: Sarah buys 4 notebooks at \$3 each and a pencil for \$2. Find the total cost.
    \item Write and solve an inequality: A box of books weighs \( x \) pounds. If 4 such boxes weigh a total of 32 pounds, find the weight of each box.
    \item Solve: The length of a rectangle is 3 cm more than twice its width. If the perimeter is 30 cm, find the width.
