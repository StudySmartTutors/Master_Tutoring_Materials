\begin{enumerate}[start=9, itemsep=5em]
    \item A car rental company charges \$40 per day and a one-time fee of \$20. Write an equation to represent the total cost (\(C\)) for \(d\) days. Solve for \(C\) when \(d = 3\).
    \item Sarah buys 4 notebooks at \$3 each and a pencil for \$2. Write and solve an equation to find the total cost.
    \item The length of a rectangle is 3 cm more than twice its width. If the perimeter is 30 cm, write and solve an equation to find the width.
    \item A box of books weighs \(x\) pounds. If 4 such boxes weigh a total of 32 pounds, write and solve an equation to find the weight of each box.
    \item A mobile plan costs \$30 per month plus \$2 for every gigabyte of data used. Write an equation to find the total cost (\(C\)) for \(g\) gigabytes. Solve for \(C\) when \(g = 5\).

You are planning a budget for a class field trip:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The cost per student is \$15, and there are 25 students.
    \item There is an additional flat fee of \$50 for the bus rental.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3em]
    \item Write an equation to calculate the total cost (\(C\)).
    \item Solve the equation to find \(C\).
    \item If an extra fee of \$5 per student is added for lunch, modify the equation and solve for \(C\) again.
