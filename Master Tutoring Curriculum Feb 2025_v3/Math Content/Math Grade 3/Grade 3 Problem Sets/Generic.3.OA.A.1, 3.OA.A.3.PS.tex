% General Comment: Template for creating problem sets in a structured format with headers, titles, and sections.
% This document uses Montserrat font and consistent styles for exercises, problems, and performance tasks.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------
% ChatGPT Directions: 
% 1. Always include a header that dynamically updates based on the standards and topic title.
%    Example: \fancyhead[L]{\textbf{<Standards>: <Topic Title>}}
%
% 2. Subsection titles should always start with "Problem Set:" followed by the topic title.
%    Example: \subsection*{Problem Set: Understanding Multiplication and Division}.
%
% 3. **Section Breakdown**:
%    - **Learning Objective**: A concise statement summarizing the goal of the problem set.
%    - **Exercises**: Focus on procedural fluency with straightforward tasks, organized by question type (e.g., multiplication, division, fill-in-the-blank, mixed operations).
%    - **Problems**: Check for deeper understanding through moderately complex scenarios. Include a variety of question types, such as multi-step problems, tasks requiring reasoning, or comprehensive skill-building beyond word problems.
%    - **Performance Task**: Real-world, open-ended tasks that require multi-step solutions or creative thinking.
%    - **Reflection**: Prompt students to reflect on their strategies and learning.
%
% 4. **Styling with tcolorbox**:
%    - Use the following guidelines for tcolorbox styling:
%        - **Frame color**: black or dark gray (colframe=black!60).
%        - **Background color**: light gray or white (colback=gray!5 or colback=white).
%        - **Title background**: slightly darker gray (colbacktitle=black!15).
%        - **Font style**: Bold and large for titles (fonttitle=\bfseries\Large).
%
% 5. **Content and Alignment**:
%    - Align tasks with the defined standard(s).
%    - Ensure a balance of exercises (procedural), problems (conceptual), and performance tasks (application).
%    - Adjust spacing for student work using \vspace and itemsep as needed.
%
% 6. **Definitions**:
%    - **Exercises**: Develop fluency (e.g., basic computations or simple tasks). Organize into clear groups by question type.
%    - **Problems**: Build understanding with moderately complex applications. Include skill checks, reasoning tasks, or more comprehensive challenges in addition to word problems.
%    - **Performance Tasks**: Require real-world application, design, or explanation.
%
% 7. **Examples**:
%    - For an exercise: "Find the quotient of \(56 \div 8\)."
%    - For a problem: "A student solves \(9 \times 8 = 72\) and claims that \(72 \div 8 = 8\). Is the student correct? Explain why."
%    - For a performance task: "Design a seating arrangement for a classroom using fractions to represent groups."
%
% 8. Use this template for future problem sets and update only the standards, topic title, and content inside each section.

% Learning Objective Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!20, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Objective:} Develop fluency with multiplication and division while connecting these operations to real-world contexts through problem-solving and creative reasoning.
\end{tcolorbox}

% Exercises Box
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Exercises, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=30pt]
\textbf{Directions:} Complete the exercises below. Follow the instructions for each group of problems.

% Multiplication and Division
\textbf{Multiply or divide as indicated:}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=.25em]
    \item  \(6 \times 7 = \)
    \item  \(56 \div 8 = \)
    \item \(4 \times 9 = \)
    \item  \(72 \div 9 = \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

% Draw Representations
\textbf{Draw and solve:}
\begin{enumerate}[start=5, itemsep=6em]
    \item Draw an array to represent \(5 \times 4\). Then find the product.
    \item Draw equal groups to represent \(20 \div 4\). Then find the quotient.
    \vspace{6em}
\end{enumerate}

% Fill-in-the-Blank
\textbf{Fill in the blank to make the equation true:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, itemsep=1em]
    \item \(8 \times \_\_\_ = 64\)
    \item \(\_\_\_ \div 4 = 6\)
    \item \(45 \div \_\_\_ = 9\)
    \item \(\_\_\_ \times 3 = 27\)
\end{enumerate}
