\subsection*{Analyzing and Citing Textual Evidence in Informational Texts}
\onehalfspacing

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Cite several pieces of textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly and inferences drawn from it.
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection*{Answer Key}

\textbf{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. \textbf{A} – Urban farming improves community relationships and food access.  
(Evidence: "Urban farms also provide access to fresh produce in areas known as food deserts.")

2. \textbf{B} – Male seahorses carry eggs in a brood pouch.  
(Evidence: "The male fertilizes the eggs internally and carries them for several weeks.")

3. \textbf{B} – The boiling step gives bagels their signature crust and chew.  
(Evidence: "Boiling locks in moisture, giving bagels their signature chewy interior.")

\textbf{Part 2: Select All That Apply Questions}

4. \textbf{A, B, C} – Urban farms reduce transportation costs and emissions.  
Urban farms provide fresh produce in food deserts.  
Urban farms improve air quality and reduce urban heat.

5. \textbf{A, D} – Male seahorses carry eggs in their brood pouch.  
Male seahorses give birth to fully developed young.

6. \textbf{A, B, D} – Bagels are shaped into rings and left to rise.  
Bagels are boiled before baking to achieve their texture.  
Barley malt syrup or honey is used for the crust.

\textbf{Part 3: Short Answer Questions}

7. \textbf{Answer:} Urban farming addresses environmental challenges by reducing food miles and lowering transportation costs and greenhouse gas emissions. It also creates green spaces that improve air quality and reduce urban heat.

8. \textbf{Answer:} The male seahorse’s role in reproduction is significant because he carries and nurtures the eggs until they are ready to hatch, providing oxygen and nutrients, which ensures the survival of the offspring.
