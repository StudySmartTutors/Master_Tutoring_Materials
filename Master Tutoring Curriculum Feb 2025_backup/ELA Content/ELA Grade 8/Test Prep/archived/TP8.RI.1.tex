% Passage
\subsection*{Passage: Understanding Saturated Fats}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Saturated fats are a type of fat found in many foods, especially animal-based products like meat, dairy, and butter. These fats are solid at room temperature, unlike unsaturated fats, which are liquid at room temperature. While fats are an essential part of a healthy diet, too much saturated fat can lead to health problems such as heart disease and high cholesterol.
    
    When consumed in moderation, saturated fats can provide energy and help the body absorb certain vitamins. However, most health experts recommend limiting the intake of saturated fats to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This is because consuming high amounts of saturated fats can raise levels of LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) in the bloodstream, which can contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries.
    
    Foods that are high in saturated fats include fatty cuts of meat, full-fat dairy products like cheese and butter, and processed foods such as baked goods and fast food. To maintain a healthy diet, it is important to balance saturated fat intake with unsaturated fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils. Opting for lean meats, low-fat dairy, and plant-based fats can help lower the risk of heart disease and promote overall health.
    
    In addition to diet, lifestyle factors such as regular exercise and avoiding smoking can also help improve heart health. Many health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommend that people aim to reduce their intake of saturated fats and focus on eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats.
