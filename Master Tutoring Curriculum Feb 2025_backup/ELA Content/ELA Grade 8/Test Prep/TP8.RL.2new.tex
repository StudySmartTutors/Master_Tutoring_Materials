1. \textbf{What theme is developed in the following excerpt?}\\
"In a small village nestled by the sea, a boy named Tomas dreamed of becoming a sailor. His parents, however, believed he should follow in their footsteps and tend to the family farm. Determined to follow his dream, Tomas spent his evenings reading books about sailing and building a small boat from scraps he gathered. Each night, after completing his chores, he would sneak down to the water and practice rowing. Over time, his dedication caught the attention of a retired sailor in the village, who offered to teach Tomas navigation and seamanship. Despite his parents' initial \\resistance, Tomas’s unwavering commitment eventually convinced them to let him pursue his aspirations. Tomas became a skilled sailor, winning races and earning the admiration of the community. His success inspired others in the village, especially children, to chase their own dreams despite the obstacles. The once-quiet village by the sea became a hub of activity, with new ventures springing up as Tomas’s determination set an example for all. This story illustrates how perseverance and dedication can transform not only one’s life but also the lives of others."

2. \textbf{How does the theme of selflessness develop in the text below?\\}
"During an unusually harsh winter, the small mountain town was cut off from nearby cities due to heavy snowfall. Supplies ran low, and a family with a sick infant struggled to survive. The townsfolk, despite having limited resources themselves, came together to help. They pooled what food they had and took turns keeping the family warm by sharing firewood. Meanwhile, a stranger passing through noticed the dire situation. Though he had been saving for his own future, he spent his entire savings to buy supplies from a nearby town and deliver them to the struggling family. He did this quietly, refusing recognition or thanks. The family recovered, and the townsfolk were deeply moved by the stranger’s actions. Inspired by his selflessness, they resolved to help each other more in times of need. The story of the stranger’s generosity became a cherished memory, passed down through generations. It reminded the town of the power of kindness, unity, and giving without expecting anything in return. This story illustrates how selflessness can unite a community and inspire collective compassion."

3. \textbf{What central idea is conveyed in the story below?\\}
"A group of friends planned an adventurous hike in a dense forest known for its challenging trails. As the sun began to set, they realized they had taken a wrong turn and were far from the designated path. Initially, panic set in, and arguments broke out as each friend blamed the other for their predicament. However, they soon understood that survival depended on teamwork. Gathering their wits, they inventoried their supplies and decided to work together. One friend climbed a tree to scout the area, while another used a compass app on her phone to determine their direction. Together, they retraced their steps and found a nearby stream that led them back to the trailhead. This experience not only taught them the importance of cooperation and trust but also strengthened their bond as friends. They returned to the forest weeks later, better prepared and determined to tackle the trail\\ successfully. The story demonstrates how challenges can be overcome through collaboration and how adversity can strengthen relationships."  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Arguing is a natural part of friendship.  
    \item Getting lost in the forest is dangerous.  
    \item Cooperation and trust help overcome challenges.
