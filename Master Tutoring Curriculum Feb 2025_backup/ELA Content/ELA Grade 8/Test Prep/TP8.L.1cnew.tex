\section*{Answer Key}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. \textbf{Which sentence contains an inappropriate shift in verb voice?}  
\textbf{Answer:} C. The dishes were washed, and then you put them away.  
\textbf{Explanation:} The sentence shifts from passive voice ("were washed") to active voice ("you put them away"). It should maintain the same voice throughout.

\vspace{1cm}
2. \textbf{Which sentence contains an inappropriate shift in verb mood?}  
\textbf{Answer:} C. The instructor recommends that you arrive early, and please be quiet during the lecture.  
\textbf{Explanation:} The first clause uses the subjunctive mood ("recommend that you arrive"), while the second clause shifts to the imperative mood ("please be quiet"). The mood should remain consistent.

\vspace{1cm}
3. \textbf{How can the inappropriate shift in verb voice be corrected?}  
\textbf{Answer:} A. The book was placed on the table, and it should be returned to the library.  
\textbf{Explanation:} The passive voice ("was placed") is maintained, and the second clause ("it should be returned") matches in passive voice.

\subsection*{Part 2: Select All That Apply Questions}

4. \textbf{Select all sentences with inappropriate shifts in verb voice:}  
\textbf{Answer:} A. The proposal was written carefully, and the board approves it. \\
B. The cat was fed by Emily, and she cleans its litter box daily. \\
D. The package arrived yesterday, and it was opened by him today.  
\textbf{Explanation:} In sentence A, the verb shifts from passive ("was written") to active ("approves"). In sentence B, there is a shift from passive ("was fed") to active ("cleans"). In sentence D, the first clause uses active voice ("arrived"), but the second shifts to passive ("was opened").  

\vspace{1cm}
5. \textbf{Which sentences contain inappropriate shifts in verb mood?}  
\textbf{Answer:} B. The teacher asked that everyone complete the project, and you must submit it on time. \\
C. If he studied harder, he might earn better grades, so study harder.  
\textbf{Explanation:} Sentence B shifts from the subjunctive mood ("asked that everyone complete") to the indicative mood ("you must submit"). Sentence C shifts from conditional ("might earn") to imperative ("study harder").

\vspace{1cm}
6. \textbf{Select all corrected sentences:}  
\textbf{Answer:} B. Emily fed the cat, and she cleans its litter box daily. \\
C. The instructions were given to the students, and they followed them precisely. \\
D. The package arrived yesterday, and he opened it today.  
\textbf{Explanation:} Sentence B maintains consistent verb voice (active). Sentence C uses the correct passive voice. Sentence D correctly keeps the active voice throughout.

\subsection*{Part 3: Short Answer Questions}

7. \textbf{Rewrite the sentence to correct the inappropriate shift in verb voice:}  
\textbf{Answer:} The essay was written by the student, and she submitted it to the teacher.  
\textbf{Explanation:} The sentence now maintains consistent verb voice (passive: "was written" and active: "submitted").

\vspace{1cm}
8. \textbf{Why is it important to maintain consistent verb voice and mood in writing? Provide an example to explain your reasoning.}  
\textbf{Answer:} Consistent verb voice and mood make writing clearer and easier to understand. For example, in the sentence "The project was completed by the team, and they presented it to the class," the use of the passive voice ("was completed") and active voice ("presented") without shifting unnecessarily keeps the writing coherent.

\subsection*{Part 4: Fill in the Blank Questions}

\textbf{Answer:} passive.

10. Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in both \underline{number} and person (first, second, or third).
