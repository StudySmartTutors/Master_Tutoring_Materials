title=Learning Objective, halign title=center, left=5pt, right=5pt, top=5pt, bottom=15pt]

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relative pronouns} are words like \textbf{who, whose, whom, which, that}. They introduce dependent clauses and connect them to independent clauses.
    \item \textbf{Relative adverbs} are words like \textbf{where, when, why}. They describe time, place, or reason and connect dependent clauses to independent clauses.
    \item A \textbf{dependent clause} introduced by a relative pronoun or adverb gives more information about a noun or pronoun in the independent clause.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

% Examples

coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]

\textbf{Example 1: Relative Pronouns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item My friend \textbf{who} loves art is painting a mural. (The clause "who loves art" gives more information about "my friend.")
    \item The dog \textbf{that} barks loudly belongs to Mr. Lee. (The clause "that barks loudly" describes "the dog.")
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Relative Adverbs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is the park \textbf{where} we played soccer. (The clause "where we played soccer" describes "the park.")
    \item I remember the day \textbf{when} I first rode a bike. (The clause "when I first rode a bike" describes "the day.")
\end{itemize}
