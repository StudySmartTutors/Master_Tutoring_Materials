\subsection*{Fictional Text: The Teamwork Challenge}

\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Jake loved playing soccer, but he always thought he was the best player on the team. He liked to take all the shots on goal and never passed the ball. One day, his coach pulled him aside and said, "Jake, you need to learn to play as part of the team. Soccer is about working together, not just showing off your skills." 

    Jake didn't understand. "But coach, I can score the goals by myself!" he protested. 

    "That's true," the coach said, "but a team wins when everyone works together, not just when one player scores all the goals. You need to trust your teammates and help each other."

    At the next game, Jake decided to listen to his coach. When he had the ball, instead of trying to score by himself, he passed it to his teammates. To his surprise, they scored a goal! He felt proud, not because he had scored, but because the team had won together.

    After the game, Jake told his coach, "I get it now. Working together is what makes a great team." The coach smiled and said, "Exactly, Jake. Teamwork is the key to success."
