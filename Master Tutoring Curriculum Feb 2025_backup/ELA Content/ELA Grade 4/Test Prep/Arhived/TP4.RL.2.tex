% Fictional Text - The Search for Max

\subsection*{Fictional Text: The Search for Max}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Sarah was playing in her backyard when she heard a loud, worried voice. It was her friend Mia, calling for her dog, Max. Mia’s face was full of worry as she ran over to Sarah. “Max is missing! I can’t find him anywhere,” Mia exclaimed. Sarah immediately felt a sense of urgency. Max had been Mia’s companion for years, and she knew how important he was to her friend. 

    “Don’t worry, Mia. We’ll find him,” Sarah said, offering a smile of reassurance. The two friends began their search around the neighborhood. They knocked on doors and asked everyone if they had seen Max. Sarah and Mia even ventured into the park, calling out Max’s name.

    After what felt like hours, Sarah spotted something in the bushes. “Mia, look! I think I see Max!” she shouted. Sure enough, there was Max, hiding behind a thick bush in the park. He looked a little scared, but he was safe. 

    Mia ran over and hugged Max tightly. “I’m so glad you’re okay!” she cried. Sarah smiled, happy to have helped her friend. It was a long day, but the joy of finding Max made it all worthwhile.
