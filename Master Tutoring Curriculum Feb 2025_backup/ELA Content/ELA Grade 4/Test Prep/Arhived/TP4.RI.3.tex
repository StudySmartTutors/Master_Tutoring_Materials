% Informational Text - First Moon Landing

\subsection*{Informational Text: The First Moon Landing}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to land on the Moon. Their spacecraft, Apollo 11, was launched by NASA, the United States' space agency. The journey to the Moon took about four days, and the astronauts had to travel over 240,000 miles to reach the lunar surface.

    When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, Armstrong famously stepped onto the surface and said, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Aldrin joined Armstrong shortly after, and the two spent several hours exploring the Moon's surface. They collected rock samples, set up experiments, and planted an American flag.

    The mission was a major achievement in space exploration. It marked the first time that humans had traveled to another celestial body. The success of Apollo 11 was the result of years of planning, research, and teamwork by scientists, engineers, and astronauts. It also demonstrated the possibilities of human space exploration and inspired generations to come.

    After spending about 21 hours on the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the Lunar Module and rejoined Michael Collins, who had been orbiting the Moon in the Command Module. The astronauts safely returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, and were celebrated as heroes around the world.
