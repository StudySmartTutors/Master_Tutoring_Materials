\subsection*{The Adventure of the Lost Treasure}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}

Once upon a time in a small town by the sea, a young boy named Luke discovered an ancient map hidden inside an old book. The map promised to lead to a treasure buried deep in the nearby mountains. Excited, Luke showed the map to his best friend, Emma. Together, they decided to embark on an adventure to find the treasure.

As they made their way up the rugged mountain paths, they encountered many challenges. First, they had to cross a roaring river. Luke, being brave, suggested they build a raft to float across. Emma was hesitant but trusted Luke’s judgment. They worked together to gather materials, and after some effort, they successfully crossed the river.

Next, they reached a dark cave. Emma was scared and wanted to turn back, but Luke encouraged her to press on. He reminded her that the treasure was close, and they couldn’t give up now. Inside the cave, they found a glowing stone, which helped them navigate through the darkness.

Finally, after what seemed like hours, they found the treasure chest hidden beneath a pile of rocks. It was filled with gold coins and jewels, but more importantly, they had learned the value of courage and teamwork. They returned to town as heroes, proud of the adventure they had shared and the challenges they had overcome together.
