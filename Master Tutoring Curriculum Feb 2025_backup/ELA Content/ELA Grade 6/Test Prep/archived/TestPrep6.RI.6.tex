% Passage
\subsection*{The Importance of Bees in Our Ecosystem}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Bees are more than just insects that buzz around flowers. They play a critical role in the environment by pollinating plants, which helps produce the food we eat. Without bees, the food chain would be severely disrupted, as many crops depend on bees for pollination. In fact, one-third of the food we consume, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts, relies on bee pollination.

    Bees also help maintain biodiversity by pollinating a variety of plants, which in turn supports ecosystems. They contribute to the survival of many different species by helping plants reproduce. Without bees, many plants would not be able to grow, leading to a loss of food for both animals and humans.

    Unfortunately, bee populations are declining. Pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change are among the major threats to bee survival. If we do not act quickly, we risk losing these essential pollinators and causing irreparable damage to our food supply and ecosystems.

    It is important for people to understand the role of bees in the environment and to take steps to protect them. Planting bee-friendly flowers, avoiding harmful pesticides, and supporting policies that protect bee habitats are just a few ways we can help save bees and ensure a healthy, sustainable future for all.
