\subsection*{Informational Text: Photosynthesis}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which provides the energy needed for photosynthesis to take place.

During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata. At the same time, plants absorb water through their roots from the soil. Once the plant has water and carbon dioxide, it uses the energy from sunlight to turn these into glucose (a form of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant for growth and energy, while the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.

The process of photosynthesis is very important because it is the foundation of the food chain. Plants are primary producers, meaning they produce the food that other organisms, like animals and humans, need to survive. Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would not be possible. 

In addition to providing food for plants, photosynthesis also helps to maintain the balance of gases in the Earth's atmosphere. By absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, plants help regulate the levels of these gases, which is vital for the survival of all living organisms.
