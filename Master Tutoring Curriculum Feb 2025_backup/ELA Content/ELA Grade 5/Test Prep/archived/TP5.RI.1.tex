\subsection*{Informational Text: Elephants}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]

\begin{spacing}{1.15}

Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. There are two main species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. African elephants are typically larger and have bigger ears, which help them keep cool in the hot African climate. Asian elephants are smaller and have more rounded ears. 

Elephants are known for their large, powerful trunks, which they use for a variety of tasks such as drinking water, picking up food, and even greeting each other. Their tusks, which are modified teeth, are also used for digging, stripping bark from trees, and as a defense against predators.

Elephants are social animals that live in groups, called herds. These herds are led by the oldest female elephant, known as the matriarch. The matriarch guides the herd, helping them find food, water, and safe places to live. Elephants are also known for their intelligence, showing emotions like joy, sadness, and even mourning when a member of their group dies.

Unfortunately, elephants are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. Their tusks are highly valued for ivory, which has led to illegal hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect elephants and their habitats, and there are laws in place to prevent poaching.
