% Passage
\subsection*{The Lost Key}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!5]
\begin{spacing}{1.15}
    Lily had always loved exploring the woods behind her house, but today felt different. The sky was overcast, and the air smelled of rain. As she wandered deeper into the trees, she stumbled upon something unusual. Half-buried in the dirt was an old, rusted key. It looked like it had been there for years, yet it seemed to be calling her.

    Curiosity piqued, Lily carefully picked it up. "What could this open?" she wondered aloud. She had lived in this town her entire life and never seen a key like it before. It didn’t look like it belonged to any lock she had ever seen.

    She tucked the key into her pocket and decided to continue her walk. As she moved further into the woods, Lily found a small, hidden door at the base of a large oak tree. It was barely visible, covered by vines and moss. The door looked old, with strange symbols etched into it. Her heart raced as she realized that the key in her pocket might fit.

    She knelt down, trembling with excitement. Slowly, she inserted the key into the lock. With a soft click, the door creaked open, revealing a narrow passageway leading into the darkness. Without hesitating, Lily stepped inside, determined to uncover the secrets hidden there.
