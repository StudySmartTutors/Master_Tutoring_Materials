\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!40, colback=gray!0, title=Learning Objective]
\textbf{Objective:} Determine the main idea of a text, explain how it is supported by key details, and summarize the text.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Part 1: Multiple-Choice Questions}

1. What is the main idea of the passage?\\
"Coral reefs are vital to marine ecosystems, serving as habitats for a wide variety of marine species, including fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. These ecosystems not only support biodiversity but also protect coastal areas by acting as natural barriers against waves and storms. Coral reefs contribute significantly to local economies through tourism and fishing industries, providing livelihoods for millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, coral reefs face significant threats from human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Rising ocean temperatures lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon that weakens and damages reefs, reducing their ability to support marine life. Without urgent action, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, regulating fishing, and minimizing pollution, coral reefs could face widespread destruction. Governments, scientists, and local communities are working together to preserve these ecosystems through marine reserves, education programs, and sustainable practices. Protecting coral reefs is essential for maintaining the health of the oceans and the economies they support."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Coral reefs only affect fish.  
    \item Coral reefs are important to ecosystems and need protection.  
    \item Climate change has no impact on coral reefs.  
    \item Coral reefs are not connected to human activities.  
\end{enumerate}

2. Which detail supports the main idea of the passage?\\
"Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, are increasingly recognized as critical solutions to global energy challenges. Unlike fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases and deplete finite resources, renewable energy is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Solar panels harness sunlight to generate electricity, while wind turbines convert wind energy into power. Hydropower uses the flow of water to produce energy, benefiting regions with abundant rivers and streams. Transitioning to renewable energy reduces pollution, slows climate change, and conserves natural resources for future generations. Additionally, the growth of renewable energy industries creates jobs and stimulates local economies. Many governments and organizations are investing in research, infrastructure, and \\incentives to promote renewable energy adoption. While challenges remain, such as the cost of technology and reliance on weather conditions, the benefits of \\renewable energy make it a cornerstone of efforts to build a cleaner, more sustainable future for the planet."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Fossil fuels are cheaper than renewable energy.  
    \item Renewable energy sources reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
    \item Wind turbines and solar panels use fossil fuels.  
    \item Renewable energy does not conserve natural resources.  
\end{enumerate}

3. What is the main idea of the passage?\\
"National parks are protected areas designed to preserve natural landscapes, wildlife, and cultural heritage. They provide safe havens for endangered species, such as wolves, bears, and eagles, while also supporting ecosystems that are essential to environmental health. National parks offer visitors opportunities to experience nature through hiking, camping, and educational programs, fostering a deeper appreciation for the environment. However, these parks face challenges, including overcrowding, pollution, and insufficient funding. Overcrowding can harm fragile ecosystems, while littering and waste damage the natural beauty of these areas. To address these issues, governments and conservation groups are working to enforce rules, allocate resources, and educate visitors about responsible behavior. By protecting national parks, we ensure that future generations can enjoy their beauty and learn about the importance of environmental stewardship. National parks are not just places for recreationâ€”they are critical to preserving biodiversity and promoting sustainable practices."\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item National parks are for outdoor activities only.  
    \item National parks face challenges that require conservation efforts.  
    \item National parks are no longer important.  
    \item Endangered species cannot live in national parks.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part 2: Select All That Apply Questions}

4. Select \textbf{all} reasons why coral reefs are important based on the passage from question 1:\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item They provide shelter for marine life.  
    \item They support fishing and tourism industries.  
    \item They have no effect on marine ecosystems.  
    \item They protect coastlines from erosion.  
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1cm}

5. What details from the passage in question 2 support the importance of renewable energy?\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Renewable energy produces little to no greenhouse gases.  
    \item Renewable energy helps conserve natural resources.  
    \item Renewable energy causes pollution.  
    \item Renewable energy is sustainable.  
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1cm}

6. What actions can help national parks thrive, based on the passage in question 3?\\
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item Visitors should follow park rules to reduce littering.  
    \item Governments should allocate resources for conservation.  
    \item Visitors should ignore rules about park preservation.  
    \item Overcrowding should be left unaddressed.  
\end{enumerate}
