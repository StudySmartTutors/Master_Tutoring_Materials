\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Informative/Explanatory writing:} In this type of essay, you are trying to thoroughly \textbf{explain} a topic. Make sure to avoid personal bias or opinions. \textcolor{red}{For example, if you are explaining the causes of a historical event, you would present the evidence without arguing which cause is most important.}
    \item \textbf{Organizing content:} Choose the structure that best fits your information:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Chronological: \textcolor{red}{If you are explaining the steps in a process or the sequence of events, organize your essay in the order they happened.}
        \item Cause and Effect: \textcolor{red}{Start with what caused the issue and then describe its effects. For instance, when discussing the Salem Witch Trials, begin with the events that created fear and superstition.}
        \item Use transitions: \textcolor{red}{Words like "therefore," "as a result," and "however" help connect ideas smoothly.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Formal style:} \textcolor{red}{Avoid informal phrases like "gonna" or "cool." Instead, use academic words like "significant" or "critical."}
    \item \textbf{In-text citations:} Always cite the sources for your evidence. \textcolor{red}{For example, "Source 2 explains that hallucinations caused by ergot poisoning might have contributed to the trials."}
\end{itemize}

title=What does the Writing Task Look Like?, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Question/Prompt:} Write a multi-paragraph essay explaining a topic based on the provided sources. Use precise evidence to support your explanations.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Directions: \textcolor{red}{Follow these stepsâ€”1. Read the sources, 2. Plan your essay, 3. Write, and 4. Revise for accuracy and clarity.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sources:} Use evidence from at least two sources. \textcolor{red}{In the Salem Witch Trials prompt, cite details from Source 2 (hallucinations) and Source 3 (social/political reasons).}
    \item \textbf{Grading Criteria:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Organization:} \textcolor{red}{Ensure each body paragraph focuses on one idea. Start with a topic sentence, include evidence, and provide analysis.}
        \item \textbf{Citations:} \textcolor{red}{Mention the source with every quotation or paraphrased fact.}
        \item \textbf{Conventions:} \textcolor{red}{Double-check grammar and punctuation. Errors should not distract the reader.}
