\textbf{Objective:} Graph proportional relationships, interpret the unit rate as the slope of the graph, and compare proportional relationships represented in different ways.
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Instructor Note:} Highlight the connection between the unit rate and the slope of the graph. Emphasize that proportional relationships always pass through the origin.}

% Key Concepts and Vocabulary
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Key Concepts and Vocabulary, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proportional Relationships:} A relationship is proportional if the ratio between the two quantities is constant, resulting in a straight-line graph that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
    \item \textbf{Unit Rate and Slope:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \textbf{unit rate} is the ratio of \(y\) to \(x\), which can be interpreted as the slope of the line in a graph of a proportional relationship.
        \item The slope formula is \(\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\), or the "rise over run."
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graphing Proportional Relationships:} Plot points using a table of values, connect them with a straight line, and ensure the graph passes through the origin.
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Instructor Note:} Before teaching, review the slope formula with students. Use examples to illustrate how to calculate slope using two points. Provide graph paper for hands-on practice.}

% Examples
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=black!60, colback=white, 
coltitle=black, colbacktitle=black!15, fonttitle=\bfseries\Large, 
title=Examples, halign title=center, left=10pt, right=10pt, top=10pt, bottom=15pt]
\textbf{Example 1: Identifying Slope from a Graph}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: The graph of a proportional relationship passes through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((4, 12)\). What is the slope of the graph?
    \item Solution:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Step 1: Use the slope formula: \(\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\). 
        \item \textcolor{red}{Substitute values: \(\text{slope} = \frac{12 - 0}{4 - 0} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\).}
        \item Final Answer: \textcolor{red}{The slope is \(3\), which means the unit rate is \(3\) units of \(y\) per \(1\) unit of \(x\).}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 2: Comparing Two Proportional Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem: Compare two proportional relationships:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Relationship A: \(y = 2x\).
        \item Relationship B: A graph passing through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((3, 12)\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Solution:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For Relationship A, \textcolor{red}{the slope is \(2\) because \(y = 2x\).}
        \item For Relationship B, calculate the slope: 
        \textcolor{red}{\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{12 - 0}{3 - 0} = \frac{12}{3} = 4\).}
        \item Final Answer: \textcolor{red}{Relationship B has a steeper slope (\(4\)) compared to Relationship A (\(2\)).}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Instructor Note:} Use these examples to show how slope relates to the steepness of a line. Encourage students to compare slopes by observing graphs or using tables.}

\textbf{Solve the following problems with teacher support:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=5em]
    \item A graph of a proportional relationship passes through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 20)\). Find the slope. \textcolor{red}{\(\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{20 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{20}{5} = 4.\)}
    \item Write the equation of a proportional relationship with a unit rate of \(6\). 
    \textcolor{red}{The equation is \(y = 6x\).}
    \item Compare two proportional relationships:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Relationship A: Table with points \((1, 4), (2, 8), (3, 12)\). \textcolor{red}{Slope: \(4\).}
        \item Relationship B: \(y = 5x\). \textcolor{red}{Slope: \(5\). Relationship B has the greater slope.}

\textbf{Helpful Tips:}
\begin{itemize}
