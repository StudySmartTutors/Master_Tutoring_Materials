B. Clean energy helps reduce pollution and improve air quality.

B. Habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change.

B. Solar and wind energy are similar but suited to different environments.

\subsection*{Part 2: Short Answer Questions}

Answer: Trees help prevent soil erosion by anchoring the soil with their roots. This prevents the soil from being washed away by rain or blown away by wind. Without trees, soil erosion can lead to the loss of fertile land and contribute to sediment build-up in rivers, which harms aquatic ecosystems.

Answer: Exercise improves mental health by reducing stress and anxiety. It releases endorphins in the brain that promote feelings of happiness. Additionally, exercise helps improve sleep patterns, boosts self-esteem, and enhances focus and energy levels.
